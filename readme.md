 Note : Same as User User Basic Plugin , But It's messaging system had been shifted to Node Js

 Node Files :
 	For Front End User File which is being used for making contact to an admin is "chat-user.js"
 	For Admin Side File which is being used for making contact to an admin is "chat-admin.js"

 	Both Files are available at JS Folder In Plugin

 	To start a node server , you have to start from Nodejs/server.js then all js code will run.
 	In server.js , You have to give the Database name and its crediantials.

```
